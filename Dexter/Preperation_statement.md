# Steps that I have taken to prepare for sandbox

# Talking with real potential users, vice principles and teachers.
- My target market is origionally k-12 Education. So I started talking to the best teachers that I knew. One is now a vice principle and the other is the head of the cybersecurity program at Davis School District. I prepared for about an hour for each interview, writing questions, scripts, interviewing, as well as reconessens with my team about the infromation that I learned

# Peer feedback
- In addition to every check in, I disscussed our project at leangth with other students, getting opinions, and refining our idea and target market. In the end we decided to change our origional target market to focus more on collage students in beginer level math classes

# Class preperation
- I decided to take a 3 credit, agentic AI class that would give me the skill set necissary to create an actual functioning AI teacher Agent. I also put my the idea behind the tutor agent into practice while tutoring my friends in CS to verify that its effectiveness.

# Learning the buissness side from other students
- Since applying, I have spent a considerable time arround a few buissness students, asking questions about their classes and getting some deep insight on what it takes to create a buissness

# Talking to Real Buisness investors
- One of my good friends accelarates start ups in his free time. He has made millions. I've had several disscussions with him, and he has ofered to mentor me, in addition to help me found the buissness. 

# Toberg lecture
- One of the biggest things that I did to prepare was to organize a lectuer with another close friend as the guest speaker. He has started a total of 14 buissness, raised millions in funding and has brought companys from zero customers to hundreds of thousands. I wanted to bring that expertise to all of my fellow sandbox applicants. We ended up haveing about 20 people in attendance.

# Attend the Bamboo HR event
- I recived an hour's notice for the Sandbox Bamboo HR event located 30 minutes away and made it before the speakers begain. There I reffered 3 differnt people that have never heard of sandbox but decided to do it. I met a few networking connections there

# Work with past sandbox alumni
- At the Bamboo event I met some alumni, Brantt Johnson in particular. We have been pinging back and forth on ways to enhance both of the projects that we are currently working on, as well as getting advice for if I make it in.

# Network with BYU alumni from Qualtrics and Lucid
- I also went and visited Qualtreics and Lucid and talked to some of the BYU alumni there to get their takes and understand what kinds of things brought Qualtrics and Lucid from start ups to multi-billion dollar buisnesses. 

# Team prep
- I have spent the last three weeks having daily meetings with my team disscussing the plans for the hackathon
