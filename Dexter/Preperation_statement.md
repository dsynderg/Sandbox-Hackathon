# Steps that I have taken to prepare for sandbox

# Talking with real potential users, vice principles and teachers.
- My target market is origionally k-12 Education. So I started talking to the best teachers that I knew. One is now a vice principle and the other is the head of the cybersecurity program at Davis School District. I prepared for about an hour for each interview, writing questions, scripts, interviewing, as well as reconcessions with my team about the information that I learned

# Peer feedback
- In addition to every check-in, I discussed our project at length with other students, getting opinions, and refining our idea and target market. In the end, we decided to change our original target market to focus more on college students in beginner-level math classes

# Class preparation
- I decided to take a 3-credit, agentic AI class that would give me the skill set necessary to create an actual functioning AI teacher Agent. I also put my idea behind the tutor agent into practice while tutoring my friends in CS to verify that its effectiveness.

# Learning the business side from other students
- Since applying, I have spent a considerable time around a few business students, asking questions about their classes and getting some deep insight on what it takes to create a business

# Talking to Real Business Investors
- One of my good friends accelarates start ups in his free time. He has made millions. I've had several discussions with him, and he has offered to mentor me, in addition to helping me found the business. 

# Toborg lecture
- One of the biggest things that I did to prepare was to organize a lecture with another close friend as the guest speaker. He has started a total of 14 businesses, raised millions in funding, and grown companies from zero to hundreds of thousands of customers. I wanted to bring that expertise to all of my fellow sandbox applicants. We ended up having about 20 people in attendance.

# Attend the Bamboo HR event
- I received an hour's notice for the Sandbox Bamboo HR event located 30 minutes away and made it before the speakers began. There, I referred 3 different people who have never heard of sandbox, but decided to do it. I met a few networking connections there

# Work with past sandbox alumni
- At the Bamboo event, I met some alumni, Brantt Johnson in particular. We have been ping-ponging back and forth on ways to enhance both of the projects that we are currently working on, as well as getting advice for if I make it in.

# Network with BYU alumni from Qualtrics and Lucid
- I also went and visited Qualtrics and Lucid and talked to some of the BYU alumni there to get their takes and understand what kinds of things brought Qualtrics and Lucid from start-ups to multi-billion dollar businesses. 

# Team prep
- I have spent the last three weeks having daily meetings with my team discussing the plans for the hackathon
