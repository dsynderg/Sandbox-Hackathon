# How we met
- I have known Mitchel for over 2 years and I met Kassidy a year ago in CS 180, and we have been good frieds ever since.
# How we found each other
- Kassidy and I have been planning on joining sandbox together long before applicaitons were open. We attend the Utah AI summet together and determied that we wanted to work together becuase of our shared interest in machine learning and programing. We figured that we would be a good fit and we were right. 
- Mitchel joined the team soon after when we were discussing our plans for the hackathon. Initially he was hesitant becuase he is an applied physics major, but we ended up selling him on the idea as a way to sharpen his coding and interpersional skills, something that he has been wanting to do for a long time but hasn't found a way to do.
- I refered them both as well as started the team.
# How much time have we spent togheter.
- Kassidy and I have been meeting almost daily, sometimes twice a day, since the kick off event. We have disscussed strategy, direction, and planning. 
- Mitchel joined our daily meetings soon after he finished his application.
# What did we plan
- We partitioned the hackathon plan into 3 portions, a website, a web chat integraion, and behavioral modificaiotn of the bot as well as back end work.
# Commitment to the team
- They are some of my closet friends, but we have determined that, at least starting out, we are each going to work on our own buissness ideas.
