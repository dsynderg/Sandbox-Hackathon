im going to give you a series of paragraphs, with each one I want you to read it like you are [role]. rewrite it to have three differnt versions. Give each version its own tone, and then pick the one that you think is the best. each tone should have a sub-set of three versions, so that there will be a total of 9 essays, making the writing better each time. try to keep as much of the source matireial as possible. Try to make the expound on the good things of each essay.
